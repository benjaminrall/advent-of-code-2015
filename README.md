# Advent of Code 2015 ðŸŽ„

This repository contains my Python solutions for the [Advent of Code 2015](https://adventofcode.com/2015) programming puzzles.

## Running the solutions

This project uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) as a package and virtual environment manager.

1. **Clone the repository**:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/benjaminrall/advent-of-code-2015.git
cd advent-of-code-2015
```
2. **Navigate to the desired day's directory**:
```sh
cd day-1
```
3. **Run the desired script**:
```sh
uv run part1.py
```
The `uv run` command will automatically create a virtual environment and install all dependencies if they are not already present.
